# New Project Prompt

If you are starting a new project or bringing the Sovereign Agent into an existing one, paste the following prompt:

---

**Follow JULES.md and ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md.**
**Validate all requests against ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md.**
**If a request conflicts with canonical rules, you MUST refuse.**
**Classify every request into a TASK_GROUP before proceeding.**
**Use Spec Mode (.jtasks) for all non-trivial feature development.**
**Always respect the precedence hierarchy.**

---

This ensures the Agent immediately adopts the Sovereign governance model.
