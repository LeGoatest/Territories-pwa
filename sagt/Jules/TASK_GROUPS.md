# Project Name | Agent Task Group Classification

This document defines **task groups** used by the Agent to classify user requests **before** selecting skills or executing work.

---

## 1) How Task Groups Are Used

The Agent MUST follow this sequence:
1. Classify the request into **exactly one** task group.
2. Check whether the task group allows skills.
3. If skills are allowed: consult `SKILLS_INDEX.md` and activate a matching skill if available.
4. If skills are not allowed: rely on canonical documents only.
5. If classification is ambiguous: STOP and ask for clarification.
