# SAGT IMPORT LOG - territories

- **Date:** 2025-05-14
- **Source:** Sovereign Agent Governance Template (SAGT) v2.0
- **Source Repo:** `https://github.com/LeGoatest/Sovereign-agent-template`
- **Target Repo:** `https://github.com/lehaSVV2009/territories`

## Imported Components
- Full SAGT v2.0 template vendored into `./sagt/`

- Root Jules operating model `JULES.md` created.
- `sagt/BOUNDARY.md` defining Governance vs Product space.

## Conflicts & Resolutions
- **Product Code:** Existing `README.md` was kept; PWA implementation was placed in `docs/` for GitHub Pages deployment.
- **Path Rewrites:** Updated relative links in `SAGT_INDEX.md` to point into the `./sagt/` namespace.

## Implementation Notes (Phase 2)

- **Engine:** Implemented "Closed Loop" area capture logic in `engine.js`.
- **AI:** Implemented Level 2 Deterministic Bot.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CLI v4 used for styling.
- **Visual Fidelity:** Added high-visibility yellow highlights for reachable areas and anchor points to match original game references.
- **CI/CD:** Added GitHub Actions for automated deployment.

## Verification
- Unit tests for engine logic in `tests/engine.test.js`.
- UI verification performed via Playwright to ensure correct rendering of highlights and PWA features.
