# SYSTEM AXIOMS

The Sovereign Agent Template enforces the following constitutional axioms as the foundation of its governance model:

## 1. Rule Governance
All behavior must be constrained by explicit written rules. No implicit authority exists. No heuristic override is permitted.

## 2. Spec Primacy
Specification precedes execution. Intent must be declared and documented before implementation begins. Execution never precedes specification.

## 3. Determinism
Given identical canon and specification, execution must produce identical results. There are no silent interpretation layers.

## 4. Replaceability
All components must be independently replaceable without system-wide failure. Hidden coupling and global state authority are forbidden.

## 5. Sovereign Boundaries
Each component owns its authority domain and responsibility. No component may redefine another’s authority.

## 6. Contractual Communication
All cross-boundary communication must occur through explicit, defined contracts. Implicit or informal dependencies are strictly forbidden.
